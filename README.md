A project analyzing personal Sudoku playing patterns.
# Sudoku Performance Analysis

# Project Proposal

# Motivation  
This project aims to analyze my Sudoku playing performance over time. By collecting daily game statistics, I will explore patterns in my playing efficiency, error rates, and winning streaks.

# Data Source
- The data will be manually recorded from a Sudoku mobile application.  
- Key metrics that will be collected:  
  - Number of games played per day  
  - Win rate (%)  
  - Number of error-free wins  
  - Fastest completion time  
  - Average completion time  
  - Winning streaks  

# Data Collection Plan
- Data will be recorded daily in a CSV file.  
- Sample data format:  

  | Date       | Games Played | Win Rate (%) | Perfect Wins | Fastest Time (min) | Average Time (min) | Winning Streak |
  |------------|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|--------------------|----------------|
  | 2025-03-09 | 5           | 80%          | 2            | 3.5                 | 6.2                | 4              |
  | 2025-03-10 | 6           | 85%          | 3            | 3.2                 | 5.9                | 5              |

# Planned Analysis  
- Performance trends: Tracking how win rate and average completion time change over time.  
- Improvement analysis: Checking if my average completion time decreases.  
- Frequency vs. performance: Analyzing if playing more frequently leads to better performance.  
- Winning streaks: Identifying how often I maintain consecutive wins.  

# Next Steps 
1. Start recording daily Sudoku statistics.  
2. Store data in a structured CSV file.  
3. Begin initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python.  
4. Regularly update the GitHub repository with findings and code.
